# 📊 **Telecom Churn Analysis**

## 📝 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom sector to identify patterns and factors that lead to customer attrition. Using a dataset, we perform **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualization** to derive actionable insights.

---

## 🔧 **Key Features**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled data type inconsistencies (e.g., converting `TotalCharges` from object to float).
   - Imputed missing or blank values with `0`.
   - Ensured data integrity by removing duplicates and standardizing categorical fields (e.g., `SeniorCitizen` values converted to `Yes`/`No`).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Examined churn percentages (26.54% of customers churned).
   - Visualized key trends across demographic and service-related variables.
   - Explored customer behavior based on **gender**, **contract types**, and **payment methods**.

3. **Insights and Visualization**:
   - Generated pie charts and bar plots to reveal the relationship between features and churn likelihood.
   - Analyzed the impact of tenure and monthly charges on customer retention.
